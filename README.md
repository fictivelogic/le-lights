# LED Ribbon Controller 
This repo is a side project of mine: using an Arduino UNO (Atmega328p) to control an addressable RGB+W LED chain of variable length using "NRZ" encoding.

Specifically, this project was built for ALITOVE SK6812 RGBW LEDs. But many other addressable LED ribbons utilize the same addressing scheme.
